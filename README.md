# Automatic-Items-Counter-on-STM8-based-Conveyor
<strong>Solo Project: Automatic Items Counter on STM8-based Conveyor</strong><br><br>
It can count each object transported by the conveyor through the laser beam. The STM8 was used by the author in this project because it has a high speed of thinking and excels in terms of performance.
