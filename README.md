# Automatic-Items-Counter-on-STM8-based-Conveyor
<strong>Solo Project: Automatic Items Counter on STM8-based Conveyor</strong><br><br>
Automatic items counter is a fast and precise tool for humans to get the sum of items. The purpose of this project is to provide education to the wider community on how to make a simple automatic item counter. This project has been implemented and took approximately 2 weeks. This system is made to be used as a complement to the conveyor. In addition, this system has also provided display and reset features for the needs of its users. The way this system works is that if the items transported by the conveyor are right in front of the laser beam, the light intensity received by the LDR sensor is low, so it is considered that there are items and starts counting. The calculation results will be displayed on the LCD screen. This project will be useful for business people, because it can increase efficiency in production. The results show that this system can function properly.

## Scanning the I2C Address on the LCD
```ino
#include <Wire.h>

void setup() {
  Wire.begin();
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial); // Wait for serial monitor
  Serial.println("\nI2C Scanner");
}

void loop() {
  int nDevices = 0;
  Serial.println("Scanning...");

  for (byte address = 1; address < 127; ++address) {
    // The i2c_scanner uses the return value of the Wire.endTransmission to see if a device did acknowledge to the address.
    Wire.beginTransmission(address);
    byte error = Wire.endTransmission();

    if (error == 0) {
      Serial.print("I2C device found at address 0x");
      if (address < 16) {
        Serial.print("0");
      }
      Serial.print(address, HEX);
      Serial.println("  !");

      ++nDevices;
    } else if (error == 4) {
      Serial.print("Unknown error at address 0x");
      if (address < 16) {
        Serial.print("0");
      }
      Serial.println(address, HEX);
    }
  }
  if (nDevices == 0) {
    Serial.println("No I2C devices found\n");
  } else {
    Serial.println("done\n");
  }
  delay(5000); // Wait 5 seconds for next scan
}
```

## Arduino IDE Setup
1. Open the ``` Arduino IDE ``` first, then open this project by clicking ``` File ``` -> ``` Open ``` :

   <table><tr><td width="810">
   
      ``` auto_counter.ino ```

   </td></tr></table><br>
   
2. Fill in the ``` Additional Board Manager URLs ``` in Arduino IDE

   <table><tr><td width="810">
      
      Click ``` File ``` -> ``` Preferences ``` -> enter the ``` Boards Manager Url ``` by copying the following link :
   
      ```
      https://github.com/tenbaht/sduino/raw/master/package_sduino_stm8_index.json
      ```

   </td></tr></table><br>

   <table>
      <tr><th width="810">

      How to setup the ``` STM8S103F3P6 ``` board
            
      </th></tr>
      <tr><td>

      • Click ``` Tools ``` -> ``` Board ``` -> ``` Boards Manager ``` -> Install ``` Sduino STM8 plain C core (non-C++) ```.

## ST-Link/V2 Setup
<img width="840" src="Assets/Documentation/Experiment/ST-Link Configuration.jpg" alt="stlink-configuration"><br><br>

<strong>Notes:</strong>

   <table><tr><td width="840">

   • The single wire interface module or ``` SWIM ``` is basically used to communicate with the ``` STM8 ``` board.
   
   • You can see the wiring between the ``` ST-Link/V2 ``` and the ``` STM8 ``` board in detail in the picture above.

   • Based on personal experience, the ``` STM8 ``` can only be programmed with ``` ST-Link ```.

   </td></tr></table>

<br><br>

## FTDI USB Setup
<img width="840" src="Assets/Documentation/Experiment/FTDI Configuration.jpg" alt="ftdi-configuration"><br><br>

<strong>Notes:</strong>

   <table><tr><td width="840">

   • Serial communication on this ``` STM8 ``` board is very possible, especially for ``` Serial Monitor ``` and ``` Serial Plotter ``` purposes. Tools that can be used for serial communication include: ``` CP2102 USB ```, ``` CH340 USB ```, ``` FTDI USB ```, or with ``` PL2303 USB ```.

   • You can see the wiring between the ``` FTDI USB ``` and the ``` STM8 ``` board in detail in the picture above.

   • Based on experience, I admit that using ``` FTDI USB ``` or ``` CP2102 USB ``` is much better than ``` PL2303 USB ``` or ``` CH340 USB ``` because they are known to be more stable in performance.

## Removing write protection on STM8
The write protection on the ``` STM8 ``` can be removed through several steps, among others :<br><br>
1. Open ``` CMD (Command Prompt) ```.<br><br>

2. Enter into the directory : 

   <table><tr><td width="810">
      
      ``` C:\Users\[Computer Name]\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\sduino\tools\STM8Tools\2019.02.05\win ```

   </td></tr></table><br>

3. Input the command:

   <table><tr><td width="810">
      
      ```
      stm8flash -cstlinkv2 -pstm8s103?3 -u
      ```

   </td></tr></table><br>
   
4. Press ``` Enter ```, then you can see the result as the picture below.
